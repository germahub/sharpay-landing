<h1>Privacy Policy of Sharpay.io</h1>

<p class="text-muted">Latest update: 1st of May 2019</p>

<p>We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high
	priority for the management of the Sharpay Inc.. The use of the Internet pages of the Sharpay Inc. is possible
	without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our
	website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and
	there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>
<p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject
	shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the
	country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Sharpay Inc.. By means of this data protection
	declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the
	personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection
	declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>
<p>As the controller, the Sharpay Inc. has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most
	complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may
	in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject
	is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.</p>
<h4>1. Definitions</h4><p>The data protection declaration of the Sharpay Inc. is based on the terms used by the European
	legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should
	be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure
	this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.</p><p>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter
	alia, the following terms:</p>
<ul style="list-style: none">
	<li><h4>a) Personal data</h4></li>
	<li><p>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&ldquo;data
			subject&rdquo;). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in
			particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online
			identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic,
			cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p></li>
	<li><h4>b) Data subject</h4></li>
	<li><p>Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the
			controller responsible for the processing.</p></li>
	<li><h4>c) Processing</h4></li>
	<li><p>Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal
			data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage,
			adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or
			otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p></li>
	<li><h4>d) Restriction of processing</h4></li>
	<li><p>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in
			the future.</p></li>
	<li><h4>e) Profiling</h4></li>
	<li><p>Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to
			evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects
			concerning that natural person&#39;s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,
			interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</p></li>
	<li><h4>f) Pseudonymisation</h4></li>
	<li><p>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be
			attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such
			additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure
			that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p></li>
	<li><h4>g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing</h4></li>
	<li><p>Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority,
			agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the
			processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or
			Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or
			Member State law.</p></li>
	<li><h4>h) Processor</h4></li>
	<li><p>Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data
			on behalf of the controller.</p></li>
	<li><h4>i) Recipient</h4></li>
	<li><p>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data
			are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in
			the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as
			recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the
			applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.</p></li>
	<li><h4>j) Third party</h4></li>
	<li><p>Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject,
			controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are
			authorised to process personal data.</p></li>
	<li><h4>k) Consent</h4></li>
	<li><p>Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data
			subject&#39;s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies
			agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.</p></li>
</ul><h4>2. Name and Address of the controller</h4><p>Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection
	Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions
	related to data protection is:</p><p>Sharpay Inc.</p><p>Belize</p><p>Email: <a href="mailto:support@sharpay.io">support@sharpay.io</a>
</p><p>Website: <a href="https://sharpay.io">https://sharpay.io</a></p>
<h4 id="cookies">3. Cookies</h4><p>The Internet pages of the Sharpay Inc. use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a
	computer system via an Internet browser.</p><p>Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a
	so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through
	which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored.
	This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from
	other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified
	using the unique cookie ID.</p>
<p>Through the use of cookies, the Sharpay Inc. can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services
	that would not be possible without the cookie setting.</p>
<p>By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind. Cookies allow
	us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier
	for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each
	time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user&#39;s
	computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the
	articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.</p>
<p>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding
	setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set
	cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all
	popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not
	all functions of our website may be entirely usable.</p>
<h4>4. Collection of general data and information</h4><p>The website of the Sharpay Inc. collects a series of general
	data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information
	are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating
	system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called
	referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol
	address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and
	information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>
<p>When using these general data and information, the Sharpay Inc. does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.
	Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of
	our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems
	and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
	prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Sharpay Inc. analyzes anonymously collected data and
	information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and
	to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log
	files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>
<h4>5. Registration on our website</h4><p>The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the
	controller with the indication of personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined
	by the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected
	and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes. The controller may request
	transfer to one or more processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose
	which is attributable to the controller.</p>
<p>By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address&mdash;assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP)
	and used by the data subject&mdash;date, and time of the registration are also stored. The storage of this data
	takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if
	necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to
	secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on
	the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the
	controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the
	nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the
	registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.</p>
<p>The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal
	data are stored about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal data at the
	request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations. The entirety of
	the controller&rsquo;s employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact persons.</p>
<h4>6. Subscription to our newsletters</h4><p>On the website of the Sharpay Inc., users are given the opportunity to
	subscribe to our enterprise&#39;s newsletter. The input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are
	transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller.</p>
<p>The Sharpay Inc. informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise
	offers. The enterprise&#39;s newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid
	e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping. A confirmation e-mail will be sent to
	the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in
	the double opt-in procedure. This confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as
	the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.</p>
<p>During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the
	Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date
	and time of the registration. The collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse
	of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of
	the controller.</p>
<p>The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter. In
	addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of
	the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the
	newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances. There will be no transfer of personal data
	collected by the newsletter service to third parties. The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the
	data subject at any time. The consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping
	the newsletter, may be revoked at any time. For the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found
	in each newsletter. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of
	the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.</p>
<h4>7. Newsletter-Tracking</h4><p>The newsletter of the Sharpay Inc. contains so-called tracking pixels. A tracking
	pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording
	and analysis. This allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns. Based on
	the embedded tracking pixel, the Sharpay Inc. may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which
	links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.</p>
<p>Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the
	controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future
	newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject. These personal data will not be passed on to third
	parties. Data subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by
	means of the double-opt-in procedure. After a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller. The
	Sharpay Inc. automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.</p>
<h4>8. Contact possibility via the website</h4><p>The website of the Sharpay Inc. contains information that enables a
	quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general
	address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or
	via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data
	transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing
	or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.</p><h4>9. Routine
	erasure and blocking of personal data</h4><p>The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the
	data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the
	European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.</p><p>If the
	storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent
	legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.</p><h4>

<h4>13. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Facebook</h4><p>On this website, the controller has
	integrated components of the enterprise Facebook. Facebook is a social network.</p>
<p>A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to
	communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may serve as a platform for the
	exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related
	information. Facebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and
	network through friend requests.</p><p>The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo
	Park, CA 94025, United States. If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the
	Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p><p>With each call-up to one
	of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook
	component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data
	subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through
	the Facebook component. An overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under
	https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. During the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware
	of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.</p>
<p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by
	the data subject&mdash;and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site&mdash;which specific sub-site
	of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is collected through the Facebook component
	and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the
	Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g. the &quot;Like&quot; button, or if the data subject submits a
	comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and
	stores the personal data.</p>
<p>Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data
	subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our
	website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not. If such a
	transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by
	logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.</p>
<p>The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at https://facebook.com/about/privacy/,
	provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook. In addition, it is
	explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition,
	different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook. These
	applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.</p>
<h4>Facebook permissions asked by this Application</h4><p>This Application may ask for some Facebook permissions
	allowing it to perform actions with the User&#39;s Facebook account and to retrieve information, including Personal
	Data, from it. This service allows this Application to connect with the User&#39;s account on the Facebook social
	network, provided by Facebook Inc.</p><p>For more information about the following permissions, refer to the <a
			href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/">Facebook permissions
		documentation</a> and to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">Facebook privacy policy</a>.</p>
<h4>14. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)</h4>
<p>On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function).
	Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about
	the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which
	a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a
	sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a
	cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.</p>
<p>The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351,
	United States.</p>
<p>For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application &quot;_gat. _anonymizeIp&quot;. By
	means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and
	anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the
	Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses the collected
	data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the
	activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.</p>
<p>Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies
	is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. With each
	call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a
	Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data
	subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising
	and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google
	gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter
	alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.</p>
<p>The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was
	made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit to our Internet site, such
	personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to
	Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.
	Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.</p>
<p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a
	corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an
	adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information
	technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any
	time via a web browser or other software programs.</p>
<p>In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google
	Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the
	chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link
	https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a
	JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google
	Analytics. The installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information
	technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must
	reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject
	or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the
	reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.</p>
<p>Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under
	https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html. Google
	Analytics is further explained under the following Link <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">https://www.google.com/analytics/</a>.
</p>
<h4>15. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Remarketing</h4><p>On this website, the
	controller has integrated Google Remarketing services. Google Remarketing is a feature of Google AdWords, which
	allows an enterprise to display advertising to Internet users who have previously resided on the enterprise&#39;s
	Internet site. The integration of Google Remarketing therefore allows an enterprise to create user-based advertising
	and thus shows relevant advertisements to interested Internet users.</p>
<p>The operating company of the Google Remarketing services is the Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View,
	CA 94043-1351, United States.</p>
<p>The purpose of Google Remarketing is the insertion of interest-relevant advertising. Google Remarketing allows us to
	display ads on the Google network or on other websites, which are based on individual needs and matched to the
	interests of Internet users.</p>
<p>Google Remarketing sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The definition of cookies
	is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google enables a recognition of the visitor of our website if he
	calls up consecutive web pages, which are also a member of the Google advertising network. With each call-up to an
	Internet site on which the service has been integrated by Google Remarketing, the web browser of the data subject
	identifies automatically with Google. During the course of this technical procedure, Google receives personal
	information, such as the IP address or the surfing behaviour of the user, which Google uses, inter alia, for the
	insertion of interest relevant advertising.</p>
<p>The cookie is used to store personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the data subject. Each time we
	visit our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject,
	is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United
	States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third
	parties.</p>
<p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a
	corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such an
	adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information
	technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies already in use by Google may be deleted at any time via
	a web browser or other software programs.</p>
<p>In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to the interest-based advertising by Google. For this
	purpose, the data subject must call up the link to www.google.com/settings/ads and make the desired settings on each
	Internet browser used by the data subject.</p>
<p>Further information and the actual data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under <a
			href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>.
</p>
<h4>16. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google-AdWords</h4><p>On this website, the
	controller has integrated Google AdWords. Google AdWords is a service for Internet advertising that allows the
	advertiser to place ads in Google search engine results and the Google advertising network. Google AdWords allows an
	advertiser to pre-define specific keywords with the help of which an ad on Google&#39;s search results only then
	displayed, when the user utilizes the search engine to retrieve a keyword-relevant search result. In the Google
	Advertising Network, the ads are distributed on relevant web pages using an automatic algorithm, taking into account
	the previously defined keywords.</p>
<p>The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, UNITED
	STATES.</p><p>The purpose of Google AdWords is the promotion of our website by the inclusion of relevant advertising
	on the websites of third parties and in the search engine results of the search engine Google and an insertion of
	third-party advertising on our website.</p>
<p>If a data subject reaches our website via a Google ad, a conversion cookie is filed on the information technology
	system of the data subject through Google. The definition of cookies is explained above. A conversion cookie loses
	its validity after 30 days and is not used to identify the data subject. If the cookie has not expired, the
	conversion cookie is used to check whether certain sub-pages, e.g, the shopping cart from an online shop system,
	were called up on our website. Through the conversion cookie, both Google and the controller can understand whether
	a person who reached an AdWords ad on our website generated sales, that is, executed or canceled a sale of
	goods.</p>
<p>The data and information collected through the use of the conversion cookie is used by Google to create visit
	statistics for our website. These visit statistics are used in order to determine the total number of users who have
	been served through AdWords ads to ascertain the success or failure of each AdWords ad and to optimize our AdWords
	ads in the future. Neither our company nor other Google AdWords advertisers receive information from Google that
	could identify the data subject.</p>
<p>The conversion cookie stores personal information, e.g. the Internet pages visited by the data subject. Each time we
	visit our Internet pages, personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject,
	is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data are stored by Google in the United
	States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third
	parties.</p>
<p>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as stated above, by means of a
	corresponding setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Such a setting
	of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from placing a conversion cookie on the information
	technology system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie set by Google AdWords may be deleted at any time via
	the Internet browser or other software programs.</p>
<p>The data subject has a possibility of objecting to the interest based advertisement of Google. Therefore, the data
	subject must access from each of the browsers in use the link www.google.de/settings/ads and set the desired
	settings.</p>

<h4>21. Legal basis for the processing</h4><p>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations
	for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for
	the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing
	operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article
	6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out
	pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company
	subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax
	obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be
	necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case,
	for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital
	information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be
	based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This
	legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if
	processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party,
	except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
	which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have
	been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if
	the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p>
<h4>22. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party</h4><p>Where the processing of personal
	data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the
	well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.</p>
<h4>23. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h4><p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of
	personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data
	is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of
	a contract.</p>
<h4>24. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a
	contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide
	such data</h4><p>We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or
	can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be
	necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be
	processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a
	contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with
	the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must
	contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is
	required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to
	provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.</p>
<h4>25. Existence of automated decision-making</h4><p>As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making
	or profiling.</p>
